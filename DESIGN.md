# Terminal in MATLAB — Design Document

## 1. Goals

### Primary Goal
Embed a fully functional terminal emulator into the MATLAB Desktop, enabling users to run CLI tools, AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code), and system commands without leaving MATLAB.

### Secondary Goals
- Provide a native, polished experience that feels built into MATLAB
- Support AI-assisted development workflows (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, etc.)
- Bridge the gap between MATLAB and modern software development tooling
- Enable workflows that are currently impossible or awkward in MATLAB: git, Docker, pip/conda/npm, SSH, HPC job submission, CI/CD interaction

```

### Decision 1: xterm.js + uihtml for the frontend
**Choice**: Use MATLAB's `uihtml` component to host an xterm.js-based terminal UI.

**Rationale**:
- `uihtml` is the officially supported way to embed web content in MATLAB UI
- xterm.js is the industry-standard terminal emulator for the web (used by VS Code, Jupyter, Theia)
- Enables rich terminal rendering (256-color, Unicode) without building a custom renderer
- Tabbed interface is straightforward to build in HTML/CSS/JS

**Key constraint**: All JS must be inline in the HTML file. External `<script src>` files loaded in uihtml are sandboxed and cannot define `window.setup`.

### Decision 2: Go binary for the backend server
**Choice**: A single Go binary (`matlab-terminal-server`) manages PTY sessions and exposes them over HTTP.

**Rationale**:
- Go compiles to a single static binary per platform — no runtime dependencies
- Cross-platform PTY support: `creack/pty` on Unix, `conpty` (ConPTY) on Windows
- Low memory footprint and fast startup
- Easy to cross-compile for all target platforms via Go build tags

### Decision 3: HTTP polling (not WebSocket)
**Choice**: MATLAB polls the Go server via HTTP at 100ms intervals. JS communicates with MATLAB via the `uihtml` Data channel (pre-R2023a) or the event-based API (R2023a+).

**Rationale**:
- uihtml serves pages over HTTPS, blocking `ws://` connections (mixed content policy)
- `wss://` with the server's self-signed cert also fails
- HTTP polling via MATLAB's `webread`/`webwrite` avoids these issues entirely

**MATLAB ↔ JS communication (branched)**:
- **R2023a+**: Uses `sendEventToHTMLSource`/`HTMLEventReceivedFcn` and `sendEventToMATLAB`/`addEventListener`. Events are queued by the framework, so no data is lost even during fast typing.
- **Pre-R2023a**: Uses the Data channel (last-write-wins). JS-side input buffering (80ms) and message queue (50ms spacing) mitigate data loss. MATLAB processes one outbound message per poll tick to prevent response overwrites.

Detection: MATLAB uses `isMATLABReleaseOlderThan('R2023a')`, JS uses `typeof component.sendEventToMATLAB === 'function'`.

**Critical constraint**: MATLAB cannot handle concurrent `webread`/`webwrite` calls. Events (timer callbacks, DataChangedFcn/HTMLEventReceivedFcn) are processed during web calls, causing re-entrant requests. All HTTP calls are serialized through a single poll timer with an outbound message queue.

### Decision 4: MATLAB manages the server lifecycle
**Choice**: The MATLAB `Terminal` class starts the Go binary on construction and kills it on cleanup/deletion.

**Rationale**:
- MATLAB "owns" the process — no orphans
- `delete` method ensures the server stops when the terminal panel closes
- The Go binary also self-terminates after an idle timeout as a safety net

### Decision 5: Asset bundling via .mat file
**Choice**: Web assets (HTML, CSS, JS) and the server binary are bundled in a `web_assets.mat` file within the .mltbx toolbox. They are extracted to `prefdir/matlab-terminal/` on first run.

**Rationale**:
- `packageToolbox` silently drops `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and binary executable files
- `.mat` files are included by the packager without issues
- Version-stamped extraction avoids redundant work on subsequent launches
- Development use (running from source) bypasses extraction and uses files directly

## 4. Security

### 4.1 Server Authentication
The Go server requires a per-session authentication token (32-char hex string) passed via the `Authorization` HTTP header. MATLAB generates this token at startup and passes it to the server as a CLI argument. The token is never exposed in HTML source.

### 4.2 Network Binding
The server binds exclusively to `127.0.0.1` (not `0.0.0.0`) on a randomly assigned port — no network exposure.

### 4.3 Command Execution
The terminal inherently provides shell access. This is by design, with the same trust model as VS Code's integrated terminal. The terminal runs with the same permissions as the MATLAB process.

### 4.4 Binary Integrity
The server binary is bundled in `web_assets.mat` and extracted locally. For manual installation via `Terminal.install()`, SHA-256 checksums in `checksums.json` are verified after download.

### 4.5 Orphan Processes
- Go binary implements an idle timeout — self-terminates when no sessions are active
- MATLAB's `delete` method sends `kill` to the server process
- The server monitors MATLAB's PID and can exit if the parent dies

## 6. HTTP API Protocol

All communication between MATLAB and the Go server uses JSON over HTTP.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/create` | Create a new PTY session (`shell`, `cols`, `rows`) → `{id, shell}` |
| POST | `/api/input` | Send keystrokes to a session (`id`, `data`) |
| POST | `/api/resize` | Resize a session's PTY (`id`, `cols`, `rows`) |
| POST | `/api/close` | Close a session (`id`) |
| GET | `/api/poll?since=N` | Long-poll for output since sequence N → `{messages}` |
| GET | `/api/sessions` | Get active session count → `{count}` |

### Message Types (in poll response)

| Type | Fields | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `output` | `id`, `seq`, `data` (base64) | Terminal output from a session |
| `exited` | `id`, `seq`, `exitCode` | Session's shell process exited |

## 7. Data Flow

### R2023a+ (Event API)

```
User types → xterm.js onData → sendEventToMATLAB('input', ...)
  → MATLAB onHTMLEvent → OutQueue
  → Poll timer drains all → POST /api/input → Go server → PTY

PTY output → Go server buffers → GET /api/poll (100ms)
  → MATLAB pollOutput → sendEventToHTMLSource('batch', ...)
  → JS handleMATLABMessage → xterm.js terminal.write()
```

### Pre-R2023a (Legacy Data Channel)

```
User types → xterm.js onData → JS input buffer (80ms)
  → Data channel → MATLAB onJSMessage → OutQueue
  → Poll timer drains one → POST /api/input → Go server → PTY

PTY output → Go server buffers → GET /api/poll (100ms)
  → MATLAB pollOutput → Data channel → JS handleMATLABMessage
  → xterm.js terminal.write()
```

On the legacy path, only one outbound message is processed per poll tick, giving JS time to read the response before Data is overwritten by poll results.

### HTML Reload on Undock/Move

When the terminal panel is undocked or moved, MATLAB reloads the HTML page inside `uihtml`, resetting all JS state. To handle this:

1. JS sends a `ready` event to MATLAB whenever `setup()` is called
2. MATLAB responds by re-sending `init` with the cached theme config
3. JS reinitializes xterm.js and creates a new terminal tab (existing server sessions continue independently)

### Instance Registry

A persistent variable inside a private static method tracks all live `Terminal` instances. `Terminal.list()` returns handles (auto-pruning deleted ones), `Terminal.closeAll()` deletes them all. Instances register on construction and deregister on `delete`.

## 8. Known Limitations

- **Character swallowing on pre-R2023a**: The legacy Data channel is property-based (last-write-wins). Fast typing can lose characters, especially in matlab-proxy. On R2023a+, the event-based API eliminates this issue.
- **Line wrapping in matlab-proxy**: Long lines may overwrite from the start instead of wrapping correctly.
- **Apps tab icon**: `AppGalleryFiles` in `ToolboxOptions` does not reliably register apps in the MATLAB Apps toolstrip.
- **uihtml caching**: MATLAB caches HTML/CSS files aggressively. Changes require a MATLAB restart to take effect.
